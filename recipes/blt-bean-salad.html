    <h1>BLT Bean Salad</h1>
    <img src="../images/blt-bean-salad.jpg" alt="A BLT Bean Salad Dish"> 

    <h2>A delicious bean salad with all the flavors of a classic BLT sandwich</h2>
    <p>
        The homemade herb-mayo dressing adds freshness while the crisp bacon and croutons add a welcomed crunch.
        It's a great way to use up those pantry beans in a summery salad you'll want to enjoy all year round.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 slices whole-wheat sandwich bread, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices thick-cut bacon (about 4 ounces), sliced into 1/4-inch-thick pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh dill</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>One 15-ounce can Great Northern or cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 heart of romaine, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Toss the bread, olive oil, a pinch of salt and several grinds of pepper on a rimmed baking sheet until combined, then spread into an even layer. 
            Bake until the croutons are golden brown and well toasted, tossing halfway through, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add the bacon to a medium skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp and well browned, about 5 minutes.
            Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon to drain.</li>
        <li>For the dressing, puree the basil, parsley, dill, mayonnaise, yogurt, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons water, 1/4 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a food processor until the herbs are finely chopped and dressing is bright green.
            Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>To assemble, add the beans, romaine, tomatoes, half the croutons and half the bacon to a large bowl.
            Add half of the herb-mayo dressing, then toss to combine.
            Transfer to a large serving bowl or platter, top with the remaining croutons and bacon and drizzle with the remaining dressing.</li>
    </ol>
